          Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being in
          climbing gyms and outdoors depend on the weather conditions. During
          the dry months, I enjoy rock climbing and bouldering in the nature,
          other times I become a gym rat.

          When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre
          movies and television shows, and I spend a large amount of my free
          time exploring the latest technology advancements in the web
          development world.
